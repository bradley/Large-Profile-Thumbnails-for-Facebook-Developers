Hello All. (This is my first commit, excuse me and please correct me if I have done anything foolish.)

This code will generate the largest possible mimic of a Facebook thumbnail for a given user without losing resolution. The generated thumbnail is not guaranteed to be exactly the same as the real thumbnail on Facebook for the user, but it is close.

Example-
You can view an example of the code here: http://www.lessucettes.com/examples/generateThumbExample.php

Required-
You will need to have a recent version of imageMagick installed that can execute the '-subimage-search' command.

Furthermore, be sure that any call to an imageMagick command, e.g.; identify or convert, contains the full path to it. For me that would be:
$HOME/local/bin/<command> etc.


About-
The code compares a given thumbnail retrieved from Facebook to the smallest version of the user's profile image which is also retrieved from Facebook. 

First the two images are saved temporarily locally, and processed with ImageMagick.

It then stores various values that will be useful in cropping the image.

Next, the temporary images are deleted from their parent directory.

Lastly, and only for example's sake, the code will output a mock-crop of the image using CSS and the stored values from earlier.


Licensing-
If you want to use this code, I would very much appreciate you referencing my name, Bradley Griffith - @bradleygriffith on Twitter, and website, http://lessucettes.com, but you do NOT have to do any such thing.
